To see the app on your computer:

1. Open terminal in this folder (power-prayer).
2. Run: npm install   (only needed once)
3. Run: npm run preview
4. Open in browser: http://localhost:3335

(If the terminal shows a different URL like http://localhost:51571, use that instead.)

Use the menu to try Login, Red Letters, P48X, David vs Goliath, and all other tools.
