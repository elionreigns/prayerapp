Upload these files to your live site (prayerauthority.com) so the Power Prayer app works (iframe + app shell at /app/):

1. public_html/.htaccess              --> upload to your site's public_html/
2. public_html/security_config.php    --> upload to your site's public_html/
3. public_html/prayers/header.php     --> upload to your site's public_html/prayers/
4. public_html/app-config.php         --> upload to your site's public_html/  (app pulls SITE_URL from here)
5. public_html/prayers/app_login_status.php --> upload to your site's public_html/prayers/  (app shows username + green dot when logged in)
   (A copy is in this repo: deploy/app_login_status.php)

header.php sets frame-ancestors so the iframe works. app_login_status.php uses the same session as login so the app shell can show "Signed in as [name]" and the green dot in the header.

To use the APP SHELL on your phone (e.g. at the beach) in the browser:
- Upload the CONTENTS of localapp/www/ (index.html, js/, css/, games/) to your live site's public_html/app/.
- On the live server, add <base href="/app/"> inside <head> of public_html/app/index.html so assets load at https://www.prayerauthority.com/app/
- On your phone, open: https://www.prayerauthority.com/app/
The app shell includes Privacy Policy and Contact in the drawer (Legal & Support). Full steps: HOST-APP-SHELL-FOR-PHONE.md

Site files for Privacy + Demo account (upload to live so App Review can use dem0/0med and privacy URL works):
- public_html/prayers/privacy.php         --> public_html/prayers/
- public_html/prayers/db_connect.php      --> public_html/prayers/
- public_html/prayers/dreams.php          --> public_html/prayers/
- public_html/prayers/urim2.php           --> public_html/prayers/
- public_html/counsel/index.php           --> public_html/counsel/
- public_html/translator/index.php        --> public_html/translator/
One-time: run create_demo_user.php on the server to create dem0/0med (then delete create_demo_user.php for security).

Before submitting to the App Store: see APP-STORE-SUBMISSION.md (what to send in) and BEFORE-YOU-SUBMIT.md (checklist).
